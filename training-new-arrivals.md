Training new arrivals
=====================

Make sure you have documentation ready that newcomers can use as a reference when they arrive. But documentation alone is far from good enough.
What I usually do is, I ask members of the team *and nearby teams* to teach our systems over many short one-on-one sessions.
The idea is more than just to distribute the workload of teaching everything,
but also to generate the opportunity to meet a diverse range of coworkers,
and to have good first interactions at the company,
making integration and onboarding smooth and easy.

Here's an email template I use to call out to the nearby teams for help.

Hey guys,
 
As you may know, we are expecting some new arrivals in the team very soon. When they arrive, please give a warm welcome to X and Y!
 
Once again, I need your help to teach the newcomers. We have many systems at {your company}. It can be confusing, complicated, sometimes even messy. Instead of the lazy approach of simply dumping documentation on the newcomers and calling "RTFM", itâ€™s probably better to spend a few short (max 1 hour) one-on-one sessions with them, explaining one specific part of our systems, and at the same time, get to know them as your new coworkers. I tried to make a fairly comprehensive list below.
 
Can you please volunteer to teach any of the topics below, and schedule a 1-hour training sessions with the newcomers?
 
Training sessions:
 
- {the main applications at your company, 1 application = 1 task}

- Operations:
  - {your authorization management system}
  - {your bug tracking system}
  - {your release management system}
  - {your scheduler system}

- Developer tools:
  - {your version control system}
  - {your package repository system}
  - {your quality management system}
  - {your continuous integration system}
  - {your license server for paid tools}
  - {your registry of virtual machines}
  - {your code review / pair programming workflow}

- Release management
  - The release cycle
  - {your different environments such as dev/uat/prod}
  - {your specific tools used for delivery}
  - How to deliver a project
 
Did I forget anything? Please let me know so I can improve this template for the future.
