The in-person interview
=======================

Two themes should be running constantly throughout the entire interview:

1. Treat the candidate as a rockstar.
2. Present your workplace and the position in the best possible light.

Preparation
-----------

Schedule the interview in a nice room, for example:

- A room with a view
- A room near the coolest teams
- A room near attractive facilities, for example the free coffee machines

Reception
---------

Receive the person with a relaxed, casual attitude, and offer a drink.
If you have free coffee, this is a good opportunity to show that off.

The interview
-------------

Before you can start asking the questions that you really want to ask,
you need to first get the candidate to relax.
It's almost impossible to see the true abilities of a stressed out and nervous candidate,
and that's not good for anyone.

Start by asking about recent experience.
Try to find something the candidate is passionate about.
What was interesting?
What was difficult?
