The in-person interview playbook
================================

Two themes should be running constantly throughout the entire interview:

1. Treat the candidate as a rockstar.
2. Present your workplace and the position in the best possible light.

Preparation
-----------

Schedule the interview in a nice room, for example:

- A room with a view
- A room near the coolest teams
- A room near attractive facilities, for example the free coffee machines
