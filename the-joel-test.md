The Joel Test
=============

If you score well on the [Joel Test](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html),
include it in your job description!

Example for Money Market team:

1. Do you use source control? -> YES
2. Can you make a build in one step? -> YES
3. Do you make daily builds? -> YES
4. Do you have a bug database? -> YES
5. Do you fix bugs before writing new code? -> YES
6. Do you have an up-to-date schedule? -> NO
7. Do you have a spec? -> NO
8. Do programmers have quiet working conditions? -> NO
9. Do you use the best tools money can buy? -> YES
10. Do you have testers? -> YES
11. Do new candidates write code during their interview? -> YES
12. Do you do hallway usability testing? -> NO

That's 8 / 12, which is not good at all. (Try to fix that!)
