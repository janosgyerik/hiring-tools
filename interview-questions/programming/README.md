Programming questions
=====================

These are programming questions to ask during in-person interviews.

Preparation
-----------

- Let the candidate / recruiter know in advance that the candidate
  will have to write a simpler program with pen and paper

- Encourage the candidate to practice before coming to the interview:

  + http://www.codingame.com/puzzles
  + https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/
  + https://oj.leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/

- Specify the appropriate difficulty level the candidate should practice.
  For max 15 minute tests, the question has to be easier than the
  easy level on the above sites.
  For longer tests, adjust accordingly.

Conducting the coding test
--------------------------

- If the interview has a non-coding part, it's good to do the coding
  part first, as it's probably the most important part, and doing it
  early is possibly less stressful overall for the candidate.

- The candidate should solve using pen and paper, or on a whiteboard

- Understand that this is stressful, so be patient with the candidate

- Encourage the candidate to speak loudly, explaining the algorithm
  and logic while writing, as if collaborating with a teammate

- Don't correct mistakes immediately. Give a few minutes to let the
  candidate discover

- Don't correct mistakes directly. Ask if the candidate is sure the
  program will work. Or the block will work. Or the line will work.
  If the candidate still doesn't get it, move on, don't correct.

- If the candidate is quiet, ask what he/she is thinking.
  comment his process while writing.

- Ask the candidate to analyze the time-complexity of the solution,
  and the possibility to improve that.

- Ask the candidate to analyze the space-complexity of the solution,
  and the possibility to improve that.

Background check
----------------

It's easy to fill a CV with buzzwords like REST, Spring, Maven, Git.
Find the relevant topics for the position, and verify the candidate's
knowledge and experience by asking specific questions.

The questions depend on the topic. No need to go too deep, 2-3 questions
should be enough. See the examples below for inspiration.

### Maven

- Is there a recommended project layout for source code, unit tests, properties files?
- Name some commands that you know: clean, compile, test, package, install
- What is the difference between `compile` and `install`?
- How would you create a JAR file from your project?
- Does the `package` command execute unit tests?

### Spring

- Which components of Spring have you worked with? Core, Jdbc, testing, JPA
- What are the main approaches of configuring an application with Spring?
- What are the advantages and drawbacks of XML-based configuration?
- What are the advantages and drawbacks of annotation-based configuration?
