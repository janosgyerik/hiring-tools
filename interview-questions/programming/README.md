Programming questions
=====================

These are programming questions to ask during in-person interviews.

Preparation
-----------

- Tell the candidate in advance that there will be a coding exercise
  on whiteboard.

- Tell the candidate to practice before the interview,
  using online judges, for example:

  + http://www.codingame.com/puzzles
  + https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/
  + https://oj.leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/

- Tell the difficulty level the candidate should practice.
  For example, for a 15 minute test,
  the question should be easier than the easy level on the above sites.
  Adjust appropriately for your project and the level of competency you're looking for.

Conducting the coding test
--------------------------

- Get to the coding exercise early in the interview.
  It reduces the stress on the candidate,
  and if the exercise doesn't go well,
  you might want to end the interview early.

- The candidate should solve using pen and paper, or on a whiteboard

- Understand that this is stressful, so be patient with the candidate

- Ask the candidate to speak loudly, explaining the algorithm
  and logic while writing, as if collaborating with a teammate

- Don't correct mistakes. Ask if the candidate is sure the
  program will work. Ask question and see how the candidate reacts.

- If the candidate is quiet, ask what he/she is thinking.
  He/she should comment his thought process while writing.

- Ask the candidate to analyze the time-complexity of the solution,
  and if it's possible to improve.

- Ask the candidate to analyze the space-complexity of the solution,
  and if it's possible to improve.

Background check
----------------

It's easy to fill a CV with fancy words like REST, Spring, Maven, Git.
Find the relevant topics for the position, and verify the candidate's
knowledge and experience by asking specific questions.

The questions depend on the topic. No need to go too deep, 2-3 questions
should be enough. See the examples below for inspiration.

### Maven

- What is the recommended project layout for source code, unit tests, properties files?
- Name some frequently used commands: clean, compile, test, package, install
- What is the difference between `compile` and `install`?
- How to create a JAR file from a project?

### Spring

- Which components of Spring have you worked with? Core, Jdbc, testing, JPA
- What are the main approaches of configuring an application with Spring?
- What are the key differences between XML-based and annotation-based configuration?
