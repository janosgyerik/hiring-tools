How to hire a programmer?
-------------------------

This repository aims to help answering this main question,
by trying to answer these smaller questions:

- How to attract good programmers?
- How to tell if a candidate is a good programmer?
- How to manage the recruiting process efficiently?

These can be broken down further to smaller pieces.
However, there are no one-site-fits-all answers to any of this.

The overall recruiting process
-------------------------------

Every company and position is different, but some elements are likely common:

1. Attract good programmers

   - Write a rock-solid and interesting job description
   - Make sure you score high on the Joel Test
   - Market the position well, and on the right channels

2. Select good programmers

   - Ask to code a homework assignment
   - Interview over the phone/skype
   - Interview in person

3. The final evaluation

### Attracting good programmers

To put it simply:

1. Write a kick-ass job description. It has to look exciting.
   Ask another person to review it. 
   Ask another person to either suggest improvements or sign a document
   that says the job is perfect in his view.

2. Include the Joel Test in the job posting if your score is 8 or more.

3. Think about what makes your workplace great and fun and include it,
   for example:
   - open-space / private offices
   - high-quality chairs
   - bookshelf with relevant literature
   - brown bag lunches
   - nerfs

### Selecting good programmers

*work in progress, heavily*

1. [Decide the selection process appropriate for the project](selection-process/README.md)
2. [Ask candidates to complete a homework assignment](selection-process/homework-assignments.md)
3. [Ask candidates to do a phone interview](selection-process/phone-interviews.md)
4. [Handling the in-person interview](selection-process/interviews.md)

### The final evaluation

When the decision to hire is not a clear YES, then it's a NO.
The ocean is big. If there is a shred of doubt, then keep fishing.

Work in progress
----------------

This is a work in progress.
There are many documents not well linked.
Look around in the files of the repository rather following links.
