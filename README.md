This is an evolving collection of hiring tools:
interview playbooks, job description templates, example homework questions,
example interview questions, competency checklists.

How to hire a programmer?
-------------------------

This repository aims to help answering this main question,
by trying to answer these smaller questions:

- How to make good programmers come to you?
- How to tell who is a good programmer?
- How to manage the recruiting process efficiently?

These can be broken down further to smaller pieces.
However, there are no simple deterministic answers, to any of this.

The overall recruiting process
-------------------------------

Every position is different, but these are common elements:

1. Attracting good programmers
   - Write a rock solid interesting offer letter
   - Score high on the Joel Test
   - Get noticed (market yourself well)

2. Selecting good programmers
   - Homework assignments
   - Phone interviews
   - In-person interviews

3. The final evaluation

### Attracting good programmers

To put it simply:

1. Write a kick-ass offer letter. It has to look exciting.
   Ask another person to review it. 
   Ask another person to either suggest improvements or sign a document
   that says the job offer is perfect in his view.

2. Include the Joel Test in the offer letter if your score is 8 or more.

3. Think about what makes your workplace great and fun and include it,
   for example:
   - open-space / private offices
   - high-quality chairs
   - bookshelf with relevant literature
   - brown bag lunches
   - nerfs

### Selecting good programmers

*work in progress, heavily*

1. [Decide the selection process appropriate for the project](selection-process/README.md)
2. [Ask candidates to complete a homework assignment](selection-process/homework-assignments.md)
3. [Ask candidates to do a phone interview](selection-process/phone-interviews.md)
4. [Handling the in-person interview](selection-process/interviews.md)

### The final evaluation

When the decision to hire is not a clear YES, then it's a NO.
The ocean is big. If there is a shred of doubt, then keep fishing.
